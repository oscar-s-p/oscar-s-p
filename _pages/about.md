I am a Master's graduate in Astrophysics, with research interest in innovative computational approaches to perform simulations, modeling and analysis of large volumes of data, and their applications to modern surveys.

I have experience in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, gravitational lensing, and computational methods (Python, AI/ML) for modeling and data analysis as key tools to understand complex phenomena, extract valuable insights, solve problems, and make predictions.

Research Experience
------
Currently I am conducting a 6-month research project at the University of San Francisco under Porf. Xiaosheng Huang, in collaboration with Light Bridges (Tenerife, Spain). We are obtaining multi-epoch photometric follow-up of gravitationally lensed quasars with the [Two-meter Twin Telescope](https://ttt.iac.es/) facility (Tenerife) and performing time-delay-sensitive
modeling with the [GIGA-Lens code](https://github.com/giga-lens/gigalens).

Previously, I developed a 3-month project at the Instituto Astrofísico de Canarias during the summer of 2024. We performed deep probing of umbral magneto-convection by analyzing observational data from the Gregor solar telescope and calculating the atmospheric profile through the inversion of spectropolarimetric signals. 

Academic Background
------
In 2025 I attained my Master's Degree in Astrophysics by the Universidad de La Laguna, Spain. During the two years it lasted I obtained broad knowledge in subjects ranging from Solar Physics to Cosmology, focusing on computational methods and theory. My Master's Thesis research work focused on 2-dimensional MHD simulations of the impact of flares on prominences in the Sun with the MPI-AMRVAC code under Prof. Fernando Moreno-Insertis and Prof. Manuel Luna.

In 2023 I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Physics by the Universidad de La Laguna, Spain. During this period I gained general knowledge of Astrophysics and focused my Bachelor's Thesis in the development of a python code to perform 1-dimensional MHD simulations under Prof. Fernando Moreno-Insertis.
